- **24/11/14** - adding an new mini to the mix in a studo move and need an easier way to sync my homebrew packages from [Ovid](https://davidawindham.com/til/docs/computers/ovid).
- **23.02.19** - Had to add another machine here and realized I don't have a README. I like to have all of my editors in sync because it just makes things easier. 

- vim over emacs
  - sunburst theme
  - Vundle for plugins
    - nerdtree, git, fugative
  - spaces over tabs
- zsh over bash
  - ohmyzsh w/ dpoggie theme
  - git, gulp, autosuggestions, substring-search
- .nvm ( Node Version Manager )
- .rvm ( Ruby Version Manager )
- Homebrew package manager
- Lots of Alias' for Git, Brew, NPM, Gulp, etc...
